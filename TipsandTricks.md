###### 2. Tax payment transactions

Record tax payments

Tax paid vs Pending vs ICA vs Movement vs Proof vs UOMI
Tax paid - the tax amount which is paid during the income year
Movement - the tax amount which is paid during the financial year (if the financial year's balance date is different from the income year's balance date, the tax paid amount in "Movement" will be different from one in "Tax paid" - this will be used in "Tax Account Movements" report
Proof - the tax amount which is paid during the financial year (if the financial year's balance date is different from the income year's balance date, the tax paid amount in "Proof" will be different from one in "Tax paid" - this will be used in "Current Tax Proof" report
ICA - the tax payment/received to be disclosed in ICA 
UOMI - when clicking this, the tax amount will be taken into account for the UOMI calculation
Pending - when clicking this, the tax amount would be processed by the IRD later on (often being used when there is a tax transfer to another IRD's account)

Update the ICA transaction type from Tax Payment workpaper
When adding a tax payment transaction, click "Impacts the ICA", the ICA transaction type will be automatically selected.
In case the transaction type is not correct, click that transaction again, click "Save" again, the transaction will be corrected automatically (i.e. Income tax paid/Tax refund will be selected, rather than Other debits/Other Credits)
